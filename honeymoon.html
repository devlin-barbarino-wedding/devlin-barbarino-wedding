<p class="text-center">We are going to Patagonia!</p>
<p>We'll be spending 7 days in Torres del Paine National Park in southern Patagonia with a couple of days either side in Santiago. From our hotel in Patagonia, we'll have breathtaking views across Peho√© Lake towards Torres del Paine Massif. We'll be taking guided tours, on foot or horseback, to the beautiful lakes, glaciers and mountains of the area. Since it will be spring when we visit, the wildflowers will be out and the winter snow beginning to melt.</p>
