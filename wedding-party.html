     Jackie and Julia's friendship has been strong since the elementary school playground. Whether it was chance or destiny, they both ended up attending UCLA for undergraduate school, where they navigated Westwood together, spent college tuition learning about dinosaurs, and made many late night trips together to Diddy Reese. Their interests led them both to spend a junior year abroad in the UK (though Jackie was in bustling London while Julia was further north being distracted by Matt). Although Jackie returned to Europe after college, and settled in Sweden, they have stayed close through Skype and other technologies that make it seem like they are still in adjacent dorms. Jackie currently lives in Gothenburg, where she works in the regional government focusing on innovation. She will probably cry at the wedding, and looks forward to spending time with her best and oldest gal pals for Matt and Julia’s celebration.

      Jessica and Julia have been friends since they were able to read, and they’ve always bonded over books, baking, and bad films. Their paths in life have stayed close in the years since, with both choosing colleges in the Los Angeles area, both returning to the Bay Area afterwards, and both ending up with jobs at Stanford University. Although Jessica recently made a move to Texas, they can now bond over cowboys and queso recipes. Jessica is a cheerful & festive lady who works in corporate event management in Austin and has greatly enjoyed talking through Julia’s wedding details, as event planning is her passion in life and work. She is looking forward to sharing a moment with one of her oldest friends on her special day, and also looking forward to finding out what cake flavor Julia has chosen.

      Matt and I grew up together - same village, same school, same friends, same football team. These days we see each other just a handful of times a year. Life has changed a lot since then and so have we. Matt met Julia, became a software engineer and moved to San Francisco. I've been 4 years writing a thesis no one will read. Even so I don't think it's mattered, seeing Matt each Christmas we cover a year in 2 beers. The friendship has required no effort, it's there when needed, and to me no less for it.

      Matt and I met in 2008 when I opened the door of my university dorm room to find him sitting nervously on the other bed. As roommates (and beyond) we formed a strong bond which I carry with me still. What's more, if you ask me over a pint, I’ll tell you about my walk-on-part in Matt and Julia's early romancing!
      We spent four years together at St. Andrews (living together for three) before we both moved on to Oxford University to pursue our professional degrees. While Matt trained in Computer Science, I am now a trainee barrister (a British lawyer who wears a wig).
      Although we are now divided by a large body of water (and land), I notice echoes of Matt in my speech and attitudes every day. It is a great privilege to know Matt and Julia: I couldn't be happier for them.
