      Matt and I grew up together - same village, same school, same friends, same football team. These days we see each other just a handful of times a year. Life has changed a lot since then and so have we. Matt met Julia, became a software engineer and moved to San Francisco. I've been 4 years writing a thesis no one will read. Even so I don't think it's mattered, seeing Matt each Christmas we cover a year in 2 beers. The friendship has required no effort, it's there when needed, and to me no less for it.
