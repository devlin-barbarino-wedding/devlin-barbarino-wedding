Matt and Julia’s romance began on the windswept coast of Scotland at the University of St. Andrews, where Julia spent her junior year of college abroad and Matt did his undergraduate studies. Their friends overlapped, they shared the same chemistry class, and soon enough they were bonding over music of the early 2000’s and their mutual cheerfulness. They stayed in touch when Julia returned to UCLA and proceeded to spend countless hours flying back and forth between the UK and US for visits. They were able to see each other more often when Julia returned to Scotland for graduate school a couple of years later. However, they were soon separated again for two years when Julia returned to the San Francisco Bay Area for a job at Stanford University, and Matt finished his studies at St Andrews and then completed a Masters degree at Oxford. Happily, they were reunited on the same continent in 2014 when Matt started an internship in Palo Alto. Now they work just 7 feet apart at Stanford University, and are both relieved that they never have to Skype each other again. They share a tiny but cozy apartment in San Francisco, where the rents are high and the hills are steep. They look forward to a lifetime of properly made cups of tea, travels to exotic locations, and unknown joys ahead.
