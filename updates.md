- __April 17th__ - If you are coming from out of town and are planning on staying in San Francisco, please be aware that Uber and Lyft are readily available to get from the airport to San Francisco, and for travel anywhere around the city. If you want to avoid renting a car entirely, you can use Uber or Lyft to get to and from Healdsburg or Geyserville. Departing from San Francisco you can book a trip in advance using [Uber](https://www.uber.com/info/scheduled-rides/) or [Lyft](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/213584118-Can-I-Schedule-a-Ride-in-Advance-). When returning to San Francisco you won't be able to book in advance, but can request a ride through the normal fashion. Please leave yourself extra time when booking a trip back from Healdsburg or Geyserville, as rides aren't as common as in San Francisco. Cost is typically ~$100-130 each way for a car that fits up to 4 people.
