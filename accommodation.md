    <p><strong>October is a busy time of year in California wine country. We highly recommend that you book accommodation as soon as possible. See below for hotel options and suggestions.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We are planning to offer a shuttle service from Healdsburg and Cloverdale. Please fill out the shuttle survey, as this will help us adjust shuttle locations and sizes.</strong></p>
    <p>Please be aware that almost everywhere in wine country requires a two-night minimum stay. If you are interested in staying only Saturday night, the Super 8 in Cloverdale offers one-night stays.</p>
