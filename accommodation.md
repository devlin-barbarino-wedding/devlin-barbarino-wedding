Please be aware that almost everywhere in wine country requires a two-night minimum stay. If you are interested in staying only Saturday night, the Super 8 in Cloverdale and the America's Best Value Inn and Suites in Healdsburg both offer one-night stays.

___Update on August 4th - America's Best Value Inn and Suites is currently sold out for October 14th. If you are looking to stay only one night, there are two options:___  
- ___Super 8 in Cloverdale, 10 minutes north of the venue (see below)___
- ___Hotels in Santa Rosa, 25 minutes south of the venue___

___However, you may want to consider making a weekend of it! Healdsburg is an adorable town with great restaurants and fun shops, and is surrounded by beautiful scenery and vineyards. The L&M Motel (see below) is an excellent alternative of similar value to America's Best Value Inn and Suites, and it's right next door, so it's ideal for the shuttle service!
