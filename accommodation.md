__October in California Wine Country is a beautiful time of year, but it is also very busy. We highly recommend that you book accommodation as soon as possible if you will be attending the wedding, especially if you plan on staying at the Super 8.__

__We will be offering a shuttle service going to and from the wedding venue from the Super 8 in Cloverdale and the Best Western Dry Creek Inn in Healdsburg. Shuttles are available to everyone - you do not need to stay in either of these hotels to use them. Further information on shuttle departure times will be provided within the formal invitations, and will also be updated on this page.__

Hotels, motels, B&Bs and AirBnBs are all available in the area around our venue. However, please be aware that almost everywhere in Wine Country requires a two-night minimum stay (i.e. Friday and Saturday nights). If you are interested in staying only Saturday night, the Super 8 in Cloverdale offers one-night stays in clean and comfortable accommodations with good reviews.

If you do plan on staying overnight in the area, the Barbarino family will be hosting a drop-in Sunday brunch in Geyserville following the wedding. Please see the Venue tab for information.
